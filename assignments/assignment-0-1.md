## Echo Server in Docker

* Write a simple echo back server in your chosen programming language in your private assignment repository (an echo server returns the same message that it receives)
* Add a `Dockerfile` at the root of your repository to run your echo server in a container (ask for help in the [course discussion forum](https://github.com/cs531-f22/cs531-f22.github.io/discussions), if needed)
* Set the default port of your server to `80` when running in a Docker container (but make it configurable)
* Validate your implementation with the [WebServer Tester](https://github.com/ibnesayeed/webserver-tester) against the `echo` test suite
* [Release](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases) your implementation with the `echo` tag
